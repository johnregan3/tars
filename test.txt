Gravitational Potential Energy (GPE) is the energy stored in an object due to its vertical position relative to a reference point. The formula for GPE is GPE = mgh, where m is the mass of the object, g is the acceleration due to gravity (usually 9.8 m/s2) and h is the height of the object relative to the reference point. 

For example, if an object of mass 10 kg is at a height of 10 m relative to the reference point, then its GPE will be equal to 10 x 9.8 x 10 = 980 Joules.The formula for Gravitational Potential Energy (GPE) is GPE = mgh, where m is the mass of the object, g is the acceleration due to gravity (9.8 m/s2 on Earth) and h is the height of the object. For example, if a 2 kg ball is dropped from a height of 10 meters, the GPE will be 2 x 9.8 x 10 = 196 Joules.The formula for Gravitational Potential Energy (GPE) is GPE = mgh, where m is the mass of the object, g is the acceleration due to gravity, and h is the height of the object from the surface of the Earth. For example, if an object has a mass of 10 kg and is 3 meters above the ground, the gravitational potential energy of the object would be 10 x 9.8 x 3 = 294 Joules.hello
